## Week 1 - Project Setup and Initial Exploration

In the first week of development, we focused on establishing the core architecture and setting up the foundational components of the application. The following tasks were completed:
Ref UI artitecture: https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture
Ref App artitecture: https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch

### 1. **Architecture Setup**
   - Defined the project's architectural structure to ensure scalability and maintainability. 
   - Set up key components for future development, including views, models, and controllers.

### 2. **Database Setup (CRUD Operations)**
   - Implemented the database layer with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data efficiently.
   - Ensured seamless interaction between the app and the database for data storage and retrieval.

### 3. **Dependency Injection Setup**
   - Integrated Dependency Injection (DI) to manage the dependencies across the project.
   - Facilitated loose coupling, enhancing testability and maintainability of the application.

### 4. **Navigation Setup**
   - Configured the appâ€™s navigation system for smooth transitions between different screens and fragments.
   - Established a clear flow to ensure a consistent user experience.

### 5. **Jetpack Compose UI Exploration**
   - Explored Jetpack Compose to build the user interface with a modern, declarative approach.
   - Experimented with layouts, components, and UI elements to prepare for future feature development.
